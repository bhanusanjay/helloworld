# Traditional ML vs. ML on Embeddings for Threat Detection
## Technical Comparison with Real-World Examples

### Executive Summary

Traditional ML treats log data as text strings and basic features, while ML on embeddings captures rich semantic relationships and contextual patterns. This fundamental difference enables embedding-based systems to detect sophisticated threats that traditional ML completely misses.

---

## **Technical Example 1: Detecting Living-off-the-Land (LotL) Attacks**

### **Scenario**: Sophisticated adversary using legitimate Windows tools for malicious purposes

**Raw Security Logs**:
```
Event 1: powershell.exe -Command "Get-WmiObject Win32_Process"
Event 2: net.exe user administrator /active:yes
Event 3: schtasks.exe /create /tn "UpdateTask" /tr "powershell.exe -enc <base64>"
Event 4: wmic.exe process call create "cmd.exe /c dir C:\Users\"
Event 5: rundll32.exe shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL powershell.exe
```

---

### **Traditional ML Approach**

**Feature Engineering**:
```python
# Traditional ML extracts basic textual features
traditional_features = {
    'process_name': ['powershell.exe', 'net.exe', 'schtasks.exe', 'wmic.exe', 'rundll32.exe'],
    'command_length': [45, 32, 67, 43, 58],
    'has_base64': [False, False, True, False, False],
    'admin_keywords': [False, True, False, False, False],
    'process_count': 5,
    'time_window': 300  # seconds
}

# Simple text-based classification
threat_score = 0.3  # Low confidence - individual commands appear legitimate
```

**Traditional ML Analysis**:
- **Process Names**: All legitimate Windows utilities ✓
- **Command Structure**: Standard syntax ✓  
- **Individual Commands**: Each appears benign ✓
- **Result**: **LOW RISK** (0.3/1.0 confidence)
- **Decision**: Alert filtered out as false positive

**Why Traditional ML Fails**: Cannot understand the semantic relationship between commands or recognize the attack pattern when using legitimate tools.

### **ML on Embeddings Approach**

**Semantic Embedding Creation**:
```python
# Create rich contextual embeddings for each command
command_embeddings = {
    'powershell_recon': [0.82, -0.34, 0.67, 0.23, -0.56, 0.91, ...],  # 768-dim vector
    'privilege_escalation': [0.23, 0.78, -0.45, 0.67, 0.34, -0.12, ...],
    'persistence_mechanism': [0.67, -0.23, 0.89, -0.45, 0.78, 0.34, ...],
    'lateral_movement': [0.45, 0.67, -0.78, 0.23, -0.34, 0.89, ...],
    'execution_technique': [0.78, -0.45, 0.23, 0.56, -0.67, 0.12, ...]
}

# Sequence embedding captures attack progression
sequence_embedding = encode_attack_sequence([
    command_embeddings['powershell_recon'],
    command_embeddings['privilege_escalation'], 
    command_embeddings['persistence_mechanism'],
    command_embeddings['lateral_movement'],
    command_embeddings['execution_technique']
])

# Contextual similarity to known attack patterns
attack_pattern_similarity = cosine_similarity(
    sequence_embedding, 
    known_apt_patterns['living_off_the_land_attacks']
)
# Result: 0.94 similarity to APT29 LotL techniques
```

**Embedding Analysis Reveals**:
```python
semantic_analysis = {
    'attack_chain_detected': True,
    'pattern_confidence': 0.94,
    'attack_classification': 'Living-off-the-Land (LotL)',
    'similar_campaigns': ['APT29', 'Cozy Bear', 'FIN7'],
    'attack_progression': {
        'reconnaissance': 0.91,      # Get-WmiObject for system enumeration
        'privilege_escalation': 0.87, # Enable admin account
        'persistence': 0.93,         # Scheduled task creation
        'lateral_movement': 0.85,    # WMIC for remote execution prep
        'execution': 0.89            # Rundll32 proxy execution
    },
    'threat_level': 'CRITICAL',
    'confidence': 0.94
}
```

**Why Embeddings Succeed**: 
- **Semantic Understanding**: Recognizes that legitimate tools are being used in an attack pattern
- **Sequential Context**: Understands the progression from recon → privilege escalation → persistence
- **Campaign Attribution**: Matches known APT tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

## **Technical Example 2: Advanced Insider Threat Detection**

### **Scenario**: Data scientist planning to steal proprietary ML models before joining competitor

**Raw Activity Logs**:
```
2024-01-15 09:23:45 - john.doe@company.com accessed dataset "customer_behavior_analysis"
2024-01-15 14:17:32 - john.doe@company.com downloaded model "recommendation_engine_v3.pkl"
2024-01-18 11:45:21 - john.doe@company.com accessed "competitive_analysis_2024.xlsx"
2024-01-19 16:30:18 - john.doe@company.com email sent to personal account with attachment
2024-01-22 08:55:43 - john.doe@company.com accessed HR system, viewed own employment record
```

---

### **Traditional ML Feature Extraction**

```python
traditional_insider_features = {
    'data_access_count': 5,
    'off_hours_activity': 0,  # All during business hours
    'external_email_count': 1,
    'hr_system_access': 1,
    'file_download_count': 2,
    'access_pattern_change': 0.23,  # Minimal statistical change
    'privilege_violations': 0,       # All authorized access
    
    # Simple anomaly score
    'anomaly_score': 0.31  # Low - activities appear normal
}

# Traditional ML decision
risk_assessment = "LOW RISK - Normal employee behavior pattern"
```

**Traditional ML Limitations**:
- **No Context Understanding**: Cannot interpret the meaning of accessed resources
- **Time-Blind**: Doesn't understand the significance of timing relative to employment events
- **Individual Event Focus**: Misses the narrative connecting separate activities

---

### **Embeddings-Based Contextual Analysis**

**Rich Contextual Embeddings**:
```python
# Create embeddings that capture semantic meaning and context
contextual_embeddings = {
    'data_access_embedding': encode_data_context({
        'dataset_type': 'proprietary customer behavior models',
        'business_value': 'extremely high - core competitive advantage', 
        'access_necessity': 'not required for current assigned projects',
        'data_sensitivity': 'trade secret level classification'
    }),
    
    'temporal_context_embedding': encode_temporal_patterns({
        'departure_timeline': 'resignation submitted 2024-01-10',
        'new_employer': 'direct competitor in recommendation systems',
        'access_timing': 'concentrated activity after resignation',
        'historical_baseline': '2-year normal access pattern comparison'
    }),
    
    'behavioral_change_embedding': encode_behavioral_shift({
        'access_scope_expansion': 'accessing data far outside normal role',
        'download_pattern_change': 'first model downloads in 18 months',
        'email_behavior_anomaly': 'first personal email with attachments',
        'hr_system_interest': 'sudden interest in employment documentation'
    }),
    
    'intent_embedding': encode_potential_intent({
        'competitive_intelligence_value': 'extremely high for new employer',
        'data_portability': 'files easily transferred and utilized',
        'legal_implications': 'trade secret theft potential',
        'insider_threat_indicators': 'classic pre-departure data collection'
    })
}

# Combine embeddings for comprehensive threat assessment
combined_threat_embedding = concatenate_embeddings([
    contextual_embeddings['data_access_embedding'],
    contextual_embeddings['temporal_context_embedding'],
    contextual_embeddings['behavioral_change_embedding'],
    contextual_embeddings['intent_embedding']
])

# Compare against known insider threat patterns
insider_threat_similarity = cosine_similarity(
    combined_threat_embedding,
    historical_insider_threat_patterns
)
```

**Embedding Analysis Results**:
```python
sophisticated_threat_analysis = {
    'threat_confidence': 0.89,
    'threat_classification': 'Pre-departure IP theft - High confidence',
    
    'contextual_insights': {
        'competitive_advantage_targeting': 0.94,  # Accessing most valuable IP
        'timing_correlation': 0.91,               # Perfect alignment with departure
        'behavioral_deviation': 0.87,             # Significant change from baseline

        'Engage legal counsel for potential injunctive relief'
    ]
}
```

## **Technical Deep Dive: Why Embeddings Provide Superior Context**

### **1. Semantic Understanding vs. String Matching**

**Traditional ML Text Processing**:
```python
# Simple keyword/pattern matching
if 'powershell' in command and '-enc' in command:
    suspicious_score += 0.3

if 'net user administrator' in command:
    privilege_escalation_score += 0.4
```

**Embeddings Semantic Analysis**:
```python
# Embeddings understand meaning and context
command_vector = embedding_model.encode(
    "powershell.exe -Command Get-WmiObject Win32_Process"
)

# Automatically recognizes similarity to reconnaissance techniques
recon_similarity = cosine_similarity(
    command_vector, 
    attack_technique_embeddings['reconnaissance']
)
# Returns 0.87 - high semantic similarity to reconnaissance
```

### **2. Multi-Dimensional Context Capture**

**Traditional ML Features** (Limited dimensions):
```python
basic_features = [
    process_count,      # 5
    time_window,        # 300 seconds  
    has_admin_keyword,  # True/False
    command_length      # 45 characters
]
# 4-dimensional representation - very limited context
```

**Embedding Representation** (Rich dimensions):
```python
threat_embedding = [
    # 768-dimensional vector capturing:
    0.82,  # Semantic meaning of command
    -0.34, # Relationship to system reconnaissance  
    0.67,  # Similarity to known attack patterns
    0.23,  # Temporal context significance
    -0.56, # User behavior deviation
    0.91,  # Attack chain progression indicator
    # ... 762 more dimensions capturing nuanced relationships
]
```

### **3. Relationship Understanding**

**Traditional ML**: Treats each log entry independently
```python
# Each event analyzed in isolation
event_1_score = analyze_single_event("powershell.exe Get-WmiObject")  # 0.2
event_2_score = analyze_single_event("net user administrator")        # 0.4  
event_3_score = analyze_single_event("schtasks /create")             # 0.3

total_score = sum(individual_scores) / len(events)  # 0.3 - LOW RISK
```

**Embeddings ML**: Understands event relationships and sequences
```python
# Sequence analysis reveals attack progression
attack_sequence_embedding = encode_sequence([
    reconnaissance_embedding,    # System enumeration
    privilege_escalation_embedding, # Admin account activation
    persistence_embedding,       # Scheduled task creation
    execution_embedding         # Command execution preparation
])

# Recognizes coordinated attack pattern
attack_pattern_confidence = 0.94  # HIGH CONFIDENCE THREAT
```
